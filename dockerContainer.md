# Docker architecture is important


docker -h Information of docker commands
docker -h | less
docker ps or docker container ls - list running docker containers
docker ps -1 or docker container ls -l - list all docker containers
docker run ubuntu - pull & run the ubuntu container from docker hub, this will pull, run and stop the ubuntu container immediately
docker run ubuntu sleep 30 - pull & run the ubuntu container from docker hub, this will pull, run and stop the ubuntu container after 30 seconds
docker run ubuntu cat /etc/os-release - create & run the ubuntu container from docker hub & run the command inside the container


docker run nginx - now the terminal is in the container terminal & you can't perform any other operation
docker container rm d6dd11b87513
you cann't remove the running container in order to remove that first stop it 
docker container stop d6 - no need to give all characters of container id you can give the starting chars which are unique
docker container rm d6d or docker rm

docker container rm 9a44 7ae - you can give multiple container id's to delete multiple container

If you want run the container in bachground, you can run it in dettached mode using -d
docker container start id - to start the non running container
docker container stop id - to stop the running container
docker container restart id - restart the container

docker container run -d ubuntu sleep 30 - run the container in detached or background mode

Interactive mode - run the container and run commands inside the container 
docker container run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
whoami -Linux
apt-get update
apt install tree 

what if you are already inside the container terminal - ctrl+p and ctrl+q will make it runs in background

Delete all the unused/stopped containers at once
Fetch all the unused container id's- docker ps -aq
Pass the o/p of above command to - docker container rm
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# Useful Commands for containers
docker -h or docker --help
docker ps -h
docker rm -h
docker ps
docker ps -a
docker ps -aq

docker attach containerid
docker -d containerid

docker rm
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

docker stop containerid
docker kill containerid
docker start containerid
docker wait containerid
docker pause containerid
docker unpause containerid

docker container run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
hoami -Linux
apt-get update
apt install tree 
tree

docker restart containerid
docker rename containerid newName
docker inspect containerid 
docker inspect containerid | less - for more readable format 

docker logs containerid 
docker logs containerid -n 5 -> 5 is n0. of lines to print

docker top containerid - process and child processes of running containers

docker exec -it containerid /bin/bash

ps -aux - process running on docker
docker starts - for cpu & memory usage

# Difference between Docker run, Docker start and Docker create
Docker create command creates a fresh new container from a docker image. However, it doesnâ€™t run it immediately.
Docker start command will start any stopped container. If you used docker create command to create a container, you can start it with this command.
Docker run command is a combination of create and start as it creates a new container and starts it immediately. In fact, the docker run command can even pull an image from Docker Hub if it doesnâ€™t find the mentioned image on your system.

netstat -n - shows ports occupied on the system

docker prune -f :- to delete all the unused containers without asking for confirmation

docker cp source containerid:destination


# Lets say you created a container and changed as follows: & you want take a copy or transfer it to another person
    docker container run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
    hoami -Linux
    apt-get update
    apt install tree 
    apt install git
    tree
    docker export containedid > myubuntu.tar or docker export containedid -o  myubuntu.tar
    docker export containedid > newubuntu.tgz or docker export containedid -o  newubuntu.tgz
    you will get this tar file current directory


    and later you can import it as image
    docker image import .\myubuntu.tar myubuntu(image name)
    docker run -it myubuntu /bin/bash
    tree
    git --version

# if you want to create a new image of runing container
docker commit  --author "sangam bgk" -m "Creating a new image from container" containedId imagename/repository:TAG 
docker commit  --author "sangam bgk" -m "Creating a new image from container" 2fd4346f2826 myubuntu 
then you can create container from that image - 
docker run -it myubuntu /bin/bash
tree
git --version
If you push it to docker hub registry then anyone can access/pull this image 

# How to push new image to docker hub
docker login -u dockerhub sangambgk 
enter password or create personal access token from docker hub
docker commit  --author "sangam bgk" -m "Creating a new image from container" containedId myubuntu(imageName)
docker image tag myubuntu sangambgk/myubuntu:tag
docker image push imageName hub.docker.com/sangambgk/imageName:tag - hub.docker.com will be default if it is docker otherwise you need to use it explicitly
docker image push sangambgk/myubuntu:v1


commit >> image tag >> image push
